Graph-related classes and algorithms.  It is surprising how many
compiler algorithms can be described in terms of pure graph
algorithms, without any additional knowledge about the instructions of
the analyzed program besides their graph structure.  This package
attempts to provide a very general library that will eliminate the
need to reimplement these algorithms for every new compiler.


<p><b>Graph model:</b> We model a directed graph ({@link
jpaul.Graphs.DiGraph DiGraph}) as a set of <i>root</i> vertices and a
{@link jpaul.Graphs.BiDiNavigator navigator} that describes the arcs
of the graph.  The navigator is an iterator over the directed graph:
given a vertex <code>v</code>, it gives <code>v</code>'s direct
successors (i.e., vertices pointed to by arcs that start in
<code>v</code>), and (in the case of a bi-directional navigator),
<code>v</code>'s direct predecessors.  The digraph consists of all the
vertices that can be reached from the roots, by following forward arcs
given by the navigator.  This design allows the use of our library
even for graphs whose arcs are not explicitly stored in the vertices.
As an example, consider a call graph: the caller-callee relation is
not usually stored at the level of each procedure; still, the call
graph is a real directed graph, and we want to be able to apply all
graph algorithms to it.

<p>
[ <i>The graph algorithms work with both {@link jpaul.Graphs.BiDiNavigator
bi-directional} and {@link jpaul.Graphs.ForwardNavigator forward-only}
navigators.  The explanation is that we can produce one kind of
navigators based on the other one: any bi-directional navigator is
trivially a forward one; conversely, given a forward navigator and a
set of roots, we can traverse the whole graph, &amp;discover&amp; the
predecessors of each vertex, and construct a bi-directional navigator.
If possible, the user can give a bi-directional navigator and spare
the cost of constructing one based on a forward-only navigator.</i> ]


<p>
<b>A note on dynamic graphs:</b> Notice that the simple graph model
described above has no mechanism for informing a graph when a mutation
is performed (e.g., when an arc is added).  For example, if one
computes the component graph of a digraph and next the underlying
digraph changes, these changes are not propagated to the component
graph.  The reasons we don't have such a mechanism are: (1) complexity
(hard to program it and hard to get it right); (2) cost; and (3) we
want our library to work with many graph-like structures that already
exist.  It is the user's responsibility to make sure that a graph does
not change in the middle of an operation on it.  E.g., a graph should
not change while we compute its component graph; if the original graph
changes and we need to update the component graph, we have to
recompute it.  This strategy is easy to implement and test, and also
seems to work well if the digraph changes come in stages (as it
usually happens in a compiler: we alternate stages of analysis and
optimization).

<p><b>Things implemented so far:</b>

<ul>

<li>Generic definition of a directed graph:
{@link jpaul.Graphs.DiGraph  DiGraph} (unlabeled digraphs) and
{@link jpaul.Graphs.LabeledDiGraph LabeledDiGraph} (labeled digraphs).

<li>General digraph algorithms: digraph union ({@link
jpaul.Graphs.DiGraph#union DiGraph.union}), dfs traversals ({@link
jpaul.Graphs.DiGraph#dfs DiGraph.dfs}), reachability ({@link
jpaul.Graphs.DiGraph#transitiveSucc DiGraph.transitiveSucc}), shortest
paths (in terms of number of edges, no weighted edges yet) ({@link
jpaul.Graphs.DiGraph#findPath DiGraph.findPath}), etc.

<li>Strongly connected components ({@link jpaul.Graphs.SCComponent
SCComponent}): given a digraph, we can construct its topologically
sorted component digraph, a digraph whose vertices are the SCCs of the
original grap; see {@link jpaul.Graphs.TopSortedCompDiGraph
TopSortedCompDiGraph} for more details.

<li>Basic block representation of a digraph: {@link
jpaul.Graphs.BasicBlockDiGraph BasicBlockDiGraph}.  A basic block
({@link jpaul.Graphs.BasicBlock BasicBlock}) is a straight-line
sequences of digraph vertices.

</ul>


<p><b>Things we would like to see implemented in the future:</b>

<ul>

<li>Support for weighted digraphs.

<li>Detection of dominators.

<li>Detection of loops.

<li>Detection of Single-Entry Single-Exit (SESE) graph regions (useful
for the SSA conversion).

</ul>
