Classes that model regular expressions and NFAs.

<p>Most of the RegExp-related packages are focused on efficiently
parsing strings of characters; they usually take a regular expression
and convert it into an NFA (a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) and
later into a DFA (a Deterministic Finite Automaton) that is used for
parsing.

<p>Instead, this package offers classes that are parametric in the
input alphabet.  Currently, the focus is on converting an NFA into a
regular expression, but ultimately, we plan to cover the other
direction too.

<p>
Where to start?

<ul>

<li>Regular expressions: {@link jpaul.RegExps.RegExp RegExp} and its inner classes.

<li>Finite automata: {@link jpaul.RegExps.NFA NFA}.

</ul>

<p>
Future plans:

<ul>

<li>RegExp 2 NFA conversion

<li>NFA 2 DFA conversion

<li>Finite automata equivalence, difference, intersection etc.

</ul>
