Test of the generic constraint solver: set constraint solver.

<p>
This package tests the generic constraint solver from the package
{@link jpaul.Constraints} by instantiating it for set constraints.  It
is mostly intended as a test case, but can also be used for set
constraint solving in research prototypes.

<p>
To obtain a set constraint solver, the only important operation was to
subclass {@link jpaul.Constraints.Var Var} into {@link
jpaul.Constraints.SetConstraints.SVar SVar}.  {@link
jpaul.Constraints.SetConstraints.SVar SVar} models a set-valued
variable; it implements implements the {@link
jpaul.Constraints.Var#copy copy} and {@link jpaul.Constraints.Var#join
join} operations for elements of powerset lattices.  {@link
jpaul.Constraints.SetConstraints.SetConstraints SetConstraints} is
just a convenience class that eases the generation of common set
constraints.

<p>
Five set constraints are available. Two of them are direct instances
of more general constraints: inclusion between two set variables and
inclusion between a constant set and a set variable (see {@link
jpaul.Constraints.SetConstraints#addInclusion
SetConstraints.addInclusion} and {@link
jpaul.Constraints.SetConstraints#addCtSource
SetConstraints.addCtSource}).  We also have three more interesting
ones: {@link jpaul.Constraints.SetConstraints.IntersectConstraint
IntersectConstraint}, {@link
jpaul.Constraints.SetConstraints.FilterConstraint FilterConstraint},
and {@link jpaul.Constraints.SetConstraints.CtDiffConstraint
CtDiffConstraint}.  You can define other constraints by subclassing
{@link jpaul.Constraints.Constraint}.
