Generic solver for inequality constraints over lattices.

<p>
This package provides a generic way of modeling and solving systems of
inequality constraints over lattices.  This package deals with
constraints of the form

   <blockquote>
   <code>
     <i>f</i>(vi_1,vi_2,...,vi_m)  &lt;=  &lt;vo_1,vo_2,...,vo_n&gt;
   </code>
   </blockquote>

where the ordering relation <code>&lt;=</code> is specific to the
relevant lattices.  The function <code><i>f</i></code> is not defined
in a specialized declarative language: instead, it is defined as a
Java method that reads the values of the input variables <code>vi_1,
..., vi_m</code>, computes some values, and finally joins the computed
values to the output variables <code>vo_1, ..., vo_m</code>; the
constraints access the values of the variables through a well-defined
interface ({@link jpaul.Constraints.SolAccessor SolAccessor}).  The
programmer can define new constraints by subclassing the {@link
jpaul.Constraints.Constraint Constraint} class.

<p>
A system of constraints may involve variables that take values in
different lattices: e.g., the values of some variables are sets of
atoms, while the values of some other variables are binary relations
between atoms.  As such, this package generalizes usual set constraint
solvers.  Of course, specialized set solvers may be much faster and
you are encouraged to take a look over them too.


<p>
The essential classes from this package are

<ul>

<li>{@link jpaul.Constraints.Var Var} - variables; also, each variable
carries with it the operations of the lattice it takes values in;

<li>{@link jpaul.Constraints.Constraint Constraint} - general form of
a constraint; each constraint should subclass this class;

<li>{@link jpaul.Constraints.ConstraintSystem ConstraintSystem} - an efficient constraint solver.

</ul>

<p>
Classes from this package are parameterized over the type of variables
(always a subtype of <code>Var</code>) and the common supertype of the
classes representing the value lattices (in the extreme case, if there
is no better supertype, this type parameter can be <code>Object</code>).
If we have several value lattices, certain type errors cannot be
detected statically: e.g., a constraint that states that a binary
relation is included in a set of atoms will trigger a dynamic
exception.  The program should be careful about this aspect when
writting constraints.

<p>
To use this package, the programmer must follow the following steps

<ol>

<li>Write one subclass of {@link jpaul.Constraints.Var Var} for each
kind of variables: e.g., one subclass for the variables that have set
values and one subclass for the variables that have relation values.
The essential point here is to define the lattice-related operations
{@link jpaul.Constraints.Var#copy copy} and {@link
jpaul.Constraints.Var#join join}.  In addition, it is usually a good
idea to add some debug information; e.g., override the default {@link
jpaul.Constraints.Var#toString Var.toString} method.

<li>If necessary, write one subclass of {@link
jpaul.Constraints.Constraint Constraint} for each kind of constraints.
This package already contains two very basic kinds of constraints
({@link jpaul.Constraints.CtConstraint CtConstraint} and {@link
jpaul.Constraints.LtConstraint LtConstraint}), but you usually need to
define your own constraints too.  Here is a sample constraint
implementation: simplified <a
href="SetConstraints/doc-files/IntersectConstraint.java">SetConstraints.IntersectConstraint</a>.

<li>Construct a collection of constraints and use {@link
jpaul.Constraints.ConstraintSystem ConstraintSystem} to solve them.
[ {@link jpaul.Constraints.ConstraintSystem ConstraintSystem}
works in two steps: first, it computes some data structures that allow
the efficient computation of a fixed-point solution; next, we can
solve it several times, at different moments in time: if some of the
constraints use external values that change, the solutions may be
different.  So, {@link jpaul.Constraints.ConstraintSystem
ConstraintSystem} is an optimized constraint system <i>schema</i> that
can be efficiently solved several times. ]
